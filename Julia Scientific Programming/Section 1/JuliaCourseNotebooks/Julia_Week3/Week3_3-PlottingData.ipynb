    "As we remarked, Plots is a package for using all the Julia plotting packages. The designer of Plots made the interesting choice (I think) to have only one active plot: if you want to make a different plot, you save your current plot and start on a new one. This simplifies the display of a plot. In our case, the notebook allows us to view different plots, because each plot is saved with its particular cell. In keeping with the idea of Plots, you cannot associate more than one plot with a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in general, if you call p``lot()`` a second time, it wipes out the old plot and draws a completely new one. But Plots *also* doesn't allow you to specify multiple different x-values for your plot. You can plot many different curves, as we did for the different countries' Ebola numbers (week 2, lecture 5), but only if they all use the same x-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable us to plot completely different curves, not only in style and colour and so on but also completely different x- and y-values, Plots gives us a function that modifies an existing plot. This function is ``plot!()``.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea is the following: specify a plot for the first set of data using ``plot()``, and then specify, on the same plot, a second set of data by using ``plot!``."
