    "- the disease spreads from infected to susceptible people\n",
    "- after a while, people are no longer infected\n",
    "- once infected, people are never infected again\n",
    "- we ignore all other differences between people\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the symbol $S$ for the number of people who are still at risk of the disease. \"$S$\" is short for \"susceptible\", meaning a person who hasn't had the disease and might catch it. We think of $S$ as a function of time, that is, we think that as the epidemic progresses, $S$ changes. Therefore we write $S(t)$ for the number of suseptibles at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number $S(0)$, which is the number of susceptibles at the start of the epidemic, is a key value in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of infected people at time $t$ is given by $I(t)$. We assume that $I(0) > 0$, because otherwise the epidemic can't start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the people previously infected but no longer infectious are called \"removed\". (Unfortunately, this doesn't mean they've recovered. They may still be ill, or as happens tragically often with Ebola, they may be dead). We use $R(t)$ to symbolise the number of removed people  at time $t$.\n",

By close we mean within a few percent. In fact, because the models are so simple and the real situation so variable, getting numbers within a few percent is a major achievement.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model steps from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$, so what we want to do is use the values of $S(t_i)$, $I(t_i)$ and $R(t_i)$ to predict the values $S(t_{i+1})$, $I(t_{i+1})$ and $R(t_{i+1})$. So our model is set up in terms of three equations.\n",

    "\n",
    "For susceptibles, there is only a loss term. The simplest SIR models come from the so-called \"law of mass action\". This law holds that all susceptibles have an equal chance of meeting an infected person. And the same is assumed for infected people. Then the number of  meetings of infecteds and susceptibles is proportional to product $SI$. We use the symbol $\\lambda$ for the constant of proportionality, and we interpret $\\lambda SI$ as the rate at which susceptibles become infected. This is of course a rate per day. So the actual loss over the time step $dt$ is actually $\\lambda SI\\,dt$ so the equation for $S$ is\n",

This gives a loss of $\\gamma I$ infecteds per day, which is $\\gamma I\\,dt$ loss of infecteds per time step. The gain of infecteds must be exactly the susceptibles who become infected, so the equation for $I$ is\n",
