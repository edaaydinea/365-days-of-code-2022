People often do---you write code as rapidly as you can, to see whether an idea could possibly work. Then if you like what you see, but the code runs slowly, you tweak it. And in Julia, this means you work on getting the types right.\n",

This gives a simple and unified way to deal with strings, but human diversity is extraodinary, and this diversity iw well expressed by the huge variety of alphabets, characters and writing systems that have been implemented for computer use. To deal with them *all* is a huge task, which the Base module in Julia does not attempt. For (most of) that, there is the JuliaString organisation.

For example, both ``Int64`` and ``Float64`` are numbers, and one can do things with numbers without knowing exactly which type of number you are dealing with.

Most of them time, this is absolutely fine, and the actual values that are used have perfectly appropriate types.
