    "Remarkably enough, data on dates and times are among the fiddliest things a data scientist has to deal with. There are a huge number of different ways in which such data are reported, and moreover there are conflicting standards of how to deal irregularities (month lengths aren't all the same, some years are leap years, time zones shift ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "In consequence, every computer language that deals with date-time data has a rich array of  functions to deal with it. In Julia, they are in a package called Dates. Of this package, we will use the functions ``DateTime()`` and ``Dates.datetime2rata()``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does one of them use the dot syntax and the other does not? The answer is that when you start up Julia, only a few of the functions in the package Dates are visible. These functions include ``DateTime()`` but not ``datetime2rata()``. However, we are able to access the other functions via the dot notation. We will talk more about packages in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``DateTime()`` function uses a format string convert string data such as we see in column one into Julia DateTime data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A format string is something one sees in many computation contexts. Here, it tells Julia in what form to expect the data. Looking at the date strings in the data, they have a number for the day, then space, then an abbreviation for the month, then a space, then a number for the year. The appropriate format string is therefore ``\"d u y\"``. These formats have limitations: ``d`` accepts one- and two-digit days (which should always work) and ``y`` accepts two- and four-digit years (which should mostly work), but ``u`` accepts only three-letter abbreviations. Unfortunately, data where the month names otherwise abbreviated are fairly common and they will need a different format string.\n",
