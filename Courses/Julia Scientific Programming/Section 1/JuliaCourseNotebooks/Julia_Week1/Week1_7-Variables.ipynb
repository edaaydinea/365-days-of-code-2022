In the statement ``Array{Int64}(undef, 3)``, the 3 is the number of elements in the first dimension. Since this is the only dimension, we end up with a one-dimensional array.

    "Well, if the variable has a definite value, then the type of the variable is the type of its value.\n",
    "\n",

It may even be that the variable has not yet been created (or, what it the same, not loaded). For instance, consider the command ``println(greeting)`` we used above. The function ``println()`` was written without knowing the type of the variable ``greeting``.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable is known only by its name, it is given the abstract type ``Any``, which is the most abstract type in Julia. That means it has no supertype, only subtypes. It is often useful to use a more restricted but still abstract subtype like ``Integer`` or ``AbstractString``, but we do not go into the details of that in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable with an abstract type can do quite a lot of things without actually being given a value that has a concrete type (see below for a simple example).\n",

    "A variable with abstract type must be given a value before it is used in a computation, otherwise Julia throws an error (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore slightly wrong to say that a variable has a type. It is the value of the variable that has a type. It's just that while a variable waits to have a particular value and hence a concrete type, it can useful to have in hand a limited set of possible types it can have. For that we use abstract types.\n",
